The programming language myths arise, I think, from a deep-rooted need for certainty. Indeed, it is possible to find certainty within a formal system. The world, however is uncertain—messy, nondeterministic, ambiguous, human. It does not lend itself to the precision required for formal definitions, and that prevents the certainties within our formal systems from being translated with confidence to the world. We should certainly continue to aspire to precision and completeness—but we should also provide support for practical software that runs in a context of inherent uncertainty."
